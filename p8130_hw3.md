Homework 3
================

# Problem 1

## part a

``` r
# extracting the lwt variable
lwt_data = birthwt |> 
  pull(lwt)
```

``` r
# calculating sample statistics
sample_mean = mean(lwt_data)
sample_sd = sd(lwt_data)
n = length(lwt_data)
```

The sample mean is (x bar) 129.8148148.  
The sample standard deviation (s) is 30.5793804.  
The *n* is 189.

``` r
# calculating the critical t value for the 95% CI, calculating the margin of error, and constructing a confidence interval
t_value = qt(0.975, df = n-1)

me = t_value * (sample_sd / sqrt(n))

lower_bound = sample_mean - me
upper_bound = sample_mean + me
ci = c(lower_bound, upper_bound)
```

The critical value (t) is 1.9726627.  
The margin of error is 4.3878383.

The 95% confidence interval of true mean weight of American women is
125.4269766, 134.2026531.

This means we are 95% confident that the true mean weight of American
women lies between 125.4270 and 134.2027.

Since the entire confidence interval is below 171 pounds, the claim may
not hold true.

# Problem 2

## part a

``` r
# separating the data into smokers and non-smokers
smokers = birthwt |> 
  filter(smoke == 1) |> 
  pull(lwt)

non_smokers = birthwt |> 
  filter(smoke == 0) |> 
  pull(lwt)
```

``` r
# calculating variances
var_smokers = var(smokers)
var_non_smokers = var(non_smokers)
```

``` r
# calculating F statistic
f_stat = var_smokers / var_non_smokers
```

``` r
# degrees of freedom
df_smokers = length(smokers) - 1
df_non_smokers = length(non_smokers) - 1
```

``` r
# finding the critical F value
alpha = 0.05
f_critical = qf(1 - alpha, df_smokers, df_non_smokers)
p_value = 1 - pf(f_stat, df_smokers, df_non_smokers)
```

The F statistic or the ratio of the variances of the two groups is
1.412636.  
The p-value or the probability of observing the F statistic if the null
is true is 0.0974.

Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, you fail to reject the null
hypothesis which means there is not enough evidence to support that the
variances of weights between smokers and non-smokers is significantly
different.

Another way to find this is by using var.test().

``` r
# F-test for equality of variances
variance = var.test(smokers, non_smokers)
```

## part c

``` r
# calculating sample means
mean_smokers = mean(smokers)
mean_non_smokers = mean(non_smokers)
```

``` r
# calculating sample standard deviations
sd_smokers = sd(smokers)
sd_non_smokers = sd(non_smokers)
```

``` r
# calculating sample sizes
n_smokers = length(smokers)
n_non_smokers = length(non_smokers)
```

``` r
# calculating pooled standard deviation
pooled_sd = sqrt(((n_smokers - 1) * sd_smokers^2 + (n_non_smokers - 1) * sd_non_smokers^2) / (n_smokers + n_non_smokers - 2))
```

``` r
# calculating t-statistic
t_stat = (mean_smokers - mean_non_smokers) / (pooled_sd * sqrt(1/n_smokers + 1/n_non_smokers))
```

``` r
# calculating degrees of freedom
df = n_smokers + n_non_smokers - 2
```

``` r
# calculating the p-value 
p_value = 2 * pt(-abs(t_stat), df)
```

The t-statistic is -0.6047303.  
The p-value is 0.5460913.

Since the p_value is greater than 0.10, you fail to reject the null
hypothesis, meaning there is not sufficient evidence and no significant
difference.

Another way to compute this test is by using t.test().

``` r
# t-test for equality of means
t_test = t.test(smokers, non_smokers, var.equal = TRUE)
```

# Problem 3

## part a

``` r
# calculating the sample proportion of mothers with hypertension
hypertension = birthwt |> 
  filter(ht == 1) |> 
  pull(ht)

n_total = nrow(birthwt)
n_hypertension = length(hypertension)
p_hat = n_hypertension / n_total
```

``` r
# calculting the standard error
standard_error = sqrt(p_hat * (1 - p_hat) / n_total)
```

``` r
# z-value for 99% CI
z_value = qnorm(0.995)
```

``` r
# calculating the margin of error
me_3a = z_value * standard_error
```

``` r
# calculating bounds of the CI
lower_bound_3a = p_hat - me_3a
upper_bound_3a = p_hat + me_3a
```

``` r
# printing CI results
ci_3a = c(lower_bound_3a, upper_bound_3a)
```

The 99% confidence interval is 0.0178041, 0.10918.

This means we are 99% confident that the true proportion of mothers with
hypertension lies between 1.78% and 10.92%. Since 0.20 is not included,
the data does not support the CDC’s claim for the sample as the
proportion of mothers suffering from hypertension is significantly lower
than 20%.

## part b

``` r
# defining the null hypothesis and calculating the test statistic
p_0 = 0.20

standard_error_3b = sqrt(p_0 * (1 - p_0) / n_total)
z_stat_3b = (p_hat - p_0) / standard_error_3b
```

``` r
# calculating the p-value for the one-sided test
p_value_3b = pnorm(z_stat_3b)
```

The z-statistic is -4.6916846.  
The p-value is 1.3548229^{-6}.

Since the p-value is less than 0.1, you reject the null hypothesis which
suggesting the proportion of mothers with hypertension is significantly
less than 20%.We can conclude that the results of the test do not
support the CDC’s claim.

# Problem 4

``` r
# extracting ui values for smokers and non-smokers
smokers_ui = birthwt |> 
  filter(smoke == 1) |> 
  pull(ui)

non_smokers_ui = birthwt |> 
  filter(smoke == 0) |> 
  pull(ui)
```

``` r
# calculating means
meanui_smokers = mean(smokers_ui)
meanui_non_smokers = mean(non_smokers_ui)
```

``` r
# calculating standard deviations
sdui_smokers = sd(smokers_ui)
sdui_non_smokers = mean(non_smokers_ui)
```

``` r
# calculating sample sizes
nui_smokers = length(smokers_ui)
nui_non_smokers = length(non_smokers_ui)
```

``` r
# calculating the pooled standard deviation
pooled_sd_4 = sqrt(((nui_smokers - 1) * sdui_smokers^2 + (nui_non_smokers - 1) * sdui_non_smokers^2) / nui_smokers + nui_non_smokers - 2)
```

``` r
# calculating the t-statistic
t_statistic = (meanui_smokers - meanui_non_smokers) / (pooled_sd_4 * sqrt(1/nui_smokers + 1/nui_non_smokers))
```

``` r
# calculating degrees of freedom
df_4 = nui_smokers + nui_non_smokers - 2
```

``` r
# calculating the p-value
p_value_4 = 2 * (1 - pt(abs(t_statistic), df_4))
```

The t-statistic is 0.0285363.  
The p-value is 0.9772649.

Since the p-value is greater than the 0.01 significance level, you fail
to reject the null hypothesis as there is not sufficient evidence to
support a significant difference in uterine irritability between smokers
and non-smokers.

Another way to do this is

``` r
# conducting t-test for equality of means
t_test_4 = t.test(smokers_ui, non_smokers_ui, var.equal = TRUE)
```

# Problem 5

## part c

``` r
# conducting ANOVA and summary of the ANOVA
anova = aov(bwt ~ factor(race), data = birthwt)

anova_summary = summary(anova)
```

The F-statistic is 4.913.  
The p-value is 0.00834.

Since the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, you
reject the null hypothesis which means there is sufficient evidence to
support a statistically significant difference in birth weight among
some racial groups.

## part d

``` r
# Tukey's HSD test
posthoc = TukeyHSD(anova)
```

The Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test is used to
perform multiple comparisons.

**Comparison 2-1**:  
The mean birth weight for group 2 is significantly lower than that for
group 1 by about 383.03 grams as the difference of means is -383.03.  
The confidence interval does not include zero \[-756.24, -9.82\], which
means there is a significant difference.  
The adjusted p-value of 0.0428 is less than 0.05, which means there is
statistical significance.

**Comparison 3-1**:  
The mean birth weight for group 3 is significantly lower than that for
group 1 by about 297.44 grams as the difference of means is -297.44.  
The confidence interval does not include zero \[-566.17, -28.71\], which
means there is a significant difference.  
The adjusted p-value of 0.0260 is less than 0.05, which means there is
statistical significance.

**Comparison 3-2**:  
There is no significant difference in mean birth between group 3 and 2
as the difference is 85.59 grams.  
The confidence interval includes zero \[-304.45, 475.63\], which means a
significant difference cannot be concluded.  
The adjusted p-value of 0.8624 is greater than 0.05, which means there
is no statistical significance.

The results suggest that racial groups associated with Group 1 have
higher mean birth weights compared to Groups 2 and 3.
